And this is like it makes the problem even harder to really focus on. But we think that what's important here is that there is a precedent not to sell recreational drugs when the public believes that they are unethical or ought not be used and to sell them on the public supports them. Secondly, we say that in order for the teachers status not to be harmed, we want to avoid unnecessary conflicts between teachers and parents if I hear that my child is hearing from his teacher, all sorts of things that I oppose. My second argument is that there are third party harms of this particular action. You have to hire collaborators, you have to lease a workspace after if you're going to put all of that effort in and put yourself at so much risk, you also have to have some sort of guarantee or probable guaranteed that this is going to be profitable for you what will does is effectively makes it impossible for someone to make this risk worth it because the second at the start something in the market, someone else can pull it up, do it better make more money and essentially kick them out. But this is also even something that I think people can generally do with pretty good information because when you're considering getting plastic surgery, it's not like doctors are allowed to not tell you the possible risks of surgery on their usually required by law to talk to you about safety affect us possible side effects of surgery, things like that. And things of this sort are meant to curb the government's ability to exercise its power swiftly and easily. But we also think that there is indeed for the state to insure than that. The only problem is they would have had to renegotiate benefit that time and time again that would have been turned down half the time that's the kind of thing that creates on comfort that's, the kind of thing that creates tensions between two countries",4,6
"370,220,451,279,362,397,218,429,112,317","It is not the case that animals hold the rights that require this to be banned is not the case that humans need to have this decision made for them and that life must be maximizing all terms for these reasons, bullfighting should not be banned. But I think that the fundamental thing that we're going to talk about is why adults ought be able to consent and participate in these kinds of activities as a brief overview. So we mean by this is well, this clearly does have to some degree objectify women. But what's important is that right now the u n doesn't, take actions that back major countries into a corner. You allow free reign to help free reign of alcohol to young people, especially people that don't have the life experience and the mental development to understand how to drink responsibly you're more likely to have these people become alcoholics in their life. So there's, really nothing that you could actually do about banning fraternities in an off campus, informal capacity. Both of these are terrible options that are far more likely if the cartel has no other option, the cartel has huge infrastructure, put in place to smuggle goods into the united states and will continue these paths. We also think that you can educate both sides of the house it's, not just when you don't ban any alcohol or don't don't have any drinking age that you can tell people that alcohol is dangerous, winning that our side of the house will have a higher leak will have any real drinking age probably around eighteen and even still have massive informational campaigns starting at a younger age that tells you about the damage that alcohol can calls with that too many areas of clash. We think it's unfair that you restrict that choice and trying to find solutions to issues and solutions to a patriarchal system. We should not abolish the US electoral college, so well, people may be with an uproar given that the two of the last five presidential elections resulted in a result in which the popular vote winner did not win the electoral college and therefore did not become president of the united states",6,6
"35,138,202,109,132,166,259,415,194,277","I think that the first issue that we need to identify here is what we mean by intellectual property rights, I think it's clear that we're talking about things like patents and trademarks and copyrights and not just something as simple as movie rights, and the like. We think the problem is that he's going to be making a lot more difficult for those who aren't having consensual sex to report it since on his side of the house will have to go through the whole criminal investigation into whether it was actually raped while on ours, the asian itself is enough to protect the kids and make it started tory and justify things like restraining orders on so it keeps them from having to go through that process like recognize it's really rare that two kids are sexting or having sex in their sent to jail because of the same age like no one cares enough to report them at that point. Well, beauty is only one metric of judging the human being it's, not invalid for someone to be empowered by their beauty and to want to express that through these type of contests. So because it's an anti colonial institution because it promotes development and because it will be to peace in the region, we should not disband ishi on. So ultimately, as long as people could set up an anonymous server in to fall, do or some other tiny country, you won't be able to enforce the laws which makes your government look weak and foolish and ultimately reduces the respect that people have for it. We think it's best to invest as much as possible, but be investments in infrastructure, create long term, economic dependency himself, said we're going to bring jobs back to north america and back to canada, or whatever note the power of potatoes in iowa just because they have so many jobs and there it is politically near impossible to get rid of entire fields of labor in democratic countries. People harpies believes about themselves, and they can't just choose to feel good about their bodies. So we think that ultimately strong men like or like middle eastern shakes who rely on oil or forced to be more aggressive when you undermine the oil revenue and that this will be to international instability, which is a tremendous harm of this policy server these for reasons we would not subsidize bio fuels. The first independent point is that there is a need for geographic representation that the electoral college uniquely provides. And the second is that people should be allowed to take risks in that risk aversion and trying to maximize the length of one's life is not the only metric of a good life lived",6,6
"348,373,510,161,221,28,251,233,66,478","When the federal government forces schools to take certain actions very bad things happen is essential that schools have control over their own curriculum and over their own time, when the federal government gets involved, the act with a new one, it is impossible to regulate every single school in the fact of way we would say that schools in poverty, it schools in low income areas which do not have access to ample physical education equipment and who do not have the resources to watch kids all going outside at the same time, probably do not need physical education. It provides people with you like firm state of closure on and like just sensually generalizes across the nation in a way that you couldn't and so we also think it allows for like smaller errors. I think that the government would point out to you that cosmetic surgery is involved in a large series of norms that are problematic to the average person that they perpetuate body problem. Two things were going to discuss today, one on international relations and direct engagement with proposition. So I think it's worth recognizing then that the veto power is one of the only things actually ensuring the stability and continuity at the united nations. The two claims made by side government in favor of abolishing the security council's veto rights are that it is unfair and that it harms the efficacy of the wind here's the thing we completely agree that that's exactly what happens in case of harming the efficacy of the when we simply think that this is accidents. I also just think that oftentimes it can be used to celebrate different kinds of attractiveness, certainly maybe not body type. But if you will lower the drinking age to such a rate that is just legal for children to do with their own volition, parents can't make that decision for them. For example, you can test and winners are able to make money and get some sort of a platforms in the contest and they win whether it's a large pat platformer, small platform depends obviously on the size, but we think that women are able to use their success in these contests to further propagate themselves whether it be in the business world or whatever other interests they may have, and we can that's a positive thing for women to be able to do and to be able to take hold of their own empowerment for these things. Also, these countries haven't had a war between them in years also probably a good thing like we're, not sure what the mark of success yeah, others trying to reach is, but it seems that these countries are at least partially doing well that may be a marker of success to yes, says look there's, no unifying factor, exactly the point",7,6
"140,216,93,0,170,92,21,454,199,470","Throughout teams entire speech, he deals with how global warming requires a drastic change from the way in which we consume energy in the status quo, and it does take a lot of time to explain this all. I think it's articulated in many other ways, such as you know, through television shows and movies it's articulated through our political system in the discourse associated with it, I don't think you need beauty pageants for there to be sexist norms of the world. This takes time this means that as our children are not really physically ready to have sex, this this social norm is increasingly becoming more and more open to the to the idea that they are with every passing generation. Adults do they can take actions that harm others such as driving while drunk, we think a higher drinking it allows you to ensure that when people do these types of things you can pull them aside, you can rest them. And the last thing I'd like to talk about is why we need to reward people for creativity in the first place. One that is logically consistent one that says, look fetuses just don't have rights. And there are a huge part of the voting populace that we ought to for to the public will and the public will stand the age of consent be somewhere between sixteen to eighteen in most free countries. And I don't think that getting rid of france is actually going to change a whole lot as far as like the way that like women feel safe on campus, probably much more effective would be just like trying to make it so that men are less likely to be problematic, rather than just trying to ban organizations that part that might contribute to these kinds of things are not really attacking the root cause of the problem you're just kind of attracting like attacking a symptom of it or like a method of it, but I think also beyond that, obviously, there's other organizations that operate similarly, there is teasing and like parties and things like that for sports teams like on other clubs and things like that do that to like the brand is to beat teams from parties before like. It just means that people are going to move to the deep web or non public communities and do all of this in secret and more than that, though, even if they do get rid of it somehow they're still like the people who would be part of this are still going to help those stocks right, like at least with anonymous forms, you're able to know how much of that exists in society in the first place which can be useful for preparing yourself with how to deal with it. This has worked partially and very slowly and I'm like we would have wanted perhaps it's time to change our approach and change the way that we treat men specifically, we advocate in this debate the already existing and rapidly growing phenomenon of things like chippendales backstreet, boys, one direction and justin bieber now, here's something that I never thought that I would say, truly our line is simple",5,6
"47,397,45,93,243,73,478,275,300,187","On the contrary you other groups, such as the ECB and european union, and which for the most part hegemon screens in the u you've countries like germany and france that are able to push around and dictate what is going on in smaller countries within the same block, where's the asia is an actual democratic body is a body that fosters global corporation and regional cooperation in a way that doesn't subjugate certain nations at the expense of more powerful nations. So there's, really nothing that you could actually do about banning fraternities in an off campus, informal capacity. So we should really be talking about is a much younger age of consent, and what james is pretending it is don't. This takes time this means that as our children are not really physically ready to have sex, this this social norm is increasingly becoming more and more open to the to the idea that they are with every passing generation. All these things come with immense economic harms and a metahuman costs as well, and all of these things are directly linked to climate change, global warming and are therefore directly linked to a continued use of renewable energies. Then removing all the sediment from large parts of north dakota is to those ecosystems. Also, these countries haven't had a war between them in years also probably a good thing like we're, not sure what the mark of success yeah, others trying to reach is, but it seems that these countries are at least partially doing well that may be a marker of success to yes, says look there's, no unifying factor, exactly the point. Our first point is that if you ban fraternities, you drive the bad behavior off campus where it is actually more difficult to monitor. And you end up in the kind of power discounts relationships that we're talking about it's just true that there's something wrong with the twenty eight year old who's dating sixteen year old that sixteen year old probably needs to be protected from them. And this is like it makes the problem even harder to really focus on",5,5
"207,343,188,283,298,92,472,443,480,511","But also in terms of the fact that you need significant amounts of information about it before you can really in for the participating, informed consent. So it's more likely that they're able to specialize and develop industries that can take advantage of other markets within easy on and two because of the access to economic development expertise recognize that many countries in AC on different levels of development, malaysia is pretty far along some other countries are not as far along. The other thing that a higher agents and sent us is that it makes people increases the amount of time before someone is likely to become sexually active because there are repercussions to their sexual acts and therefore gives more time for them to learn about things such as safe sex and stds. And although many individuals like to pretend as the bio fuels are more efficient or better for the environment, most bio fuels are actually worse than fossil fuels. This could be, you know, physical, like actual health risks associated with it. One that is logically consistent one that says, look fetuses just don't have rights. But when there's a drug prohibition against the action when you're worried about getting caught doing it, regardless of who's around you are secondary of clash is about how it's most democratic because as usual says a lot of the time these kinds of rules, and these kind of acts are determined by the surrounding society. So we don't think that these sites are going to comply, but even with regards to other sites like facebook and you know, like they talk about like four chan for example, I think there is one the problem of international enforcement that is that these sites exist across state borders, so it will be extremely difficult for individual governments to make these requirements. And finally getting an abortion is just a hard choice for women so it's something that they can't just it's, not just something that a lot of people like come to the conclusion very easily, some people struggle with that decision. This is obviously a gradual situation, but we believe that then within a few generations, we will most definitely be there",5,4
"255,437,282,402,189,424,285,518,394,392","We think that person should be forced to recognize that the issues of rural and urban of coastal states enough internal states of all these groups and we think that the US electoral college best does her best ensures that that's the case. We find all three of these claims problematic let's, examine them closely and understand why. We think that intellectual property rights ensure that creators get to profit off of their efforts to get to profit off of their intellectual property. Our second independent point is third party harms that are generated by consumption of marijuana. I think gov tries to preempt this by being like the black market has more gateway opportunities because the nature of the transaction I think you can just wait this out with the scope of consumption that more people smoke on their side houses result, you get more gateway activity on their side of the house. We would say that all that does is create a vacuum or the presently rich and powerful can decide literally every rule they want for themselves incredibly little government oversight. My third argument is the idea of regulation you cannot trust individuals to police themselves. We usually say that eighteen year old probably shouldn't drink because they're prefrontal cortex is growing expanding and essentially becoming more effective alcohol can inhibit this, but if children as young as ten are drinking alcohol, the entirety of their brain is growing their forening, the synapses that will be effective in living for their entire lives, they consume alcohol at this young age, we would say that they were likely to face profound consequences for their overall development, the likely to face more issues later in life, anger, issues emotional issues as they are not able to effectively grow. One yell starts out with the assumption that this has been tried for years and has failed we're, not entirely sure where he gets the notion that it failed. We think this is because individuals have the ability to make decisions based on their personal preferences and priorities that the state simply doesn't know or understand",6,7
"396,474,282,312,142,61,53,141,403,391","So first wise development, the most important good, if you think about the quality of life in AC on countries, obviously it varies people in malaysia, for instance, have like a middle income quality of life people in vietnam are much poorer, but we think it overall everyone in all of these countries could still benefit from more development. But at the point in which you're making a decision to axe blade wind power that over something that's cheaper, but more environmentally destructive like oil or natural gas, then you probably have the capability to invest in alternative forms of green energy, besides when our so things like solar energy, your hydro electric energy. We think that intellectual property rights ensure that creators get to profit off of their efforts to get to profit off of their intellectual property. We should not adopt libertarianism, because I think on both principal and on a practical level of how the world works libertarianism is a rather flawed ideology, so let's start by talking about what actually defines libertarianism. But but nevertheless exist in an informal capacity off campus, because, like, obviously you can stop people from getting houses off campus with their friends and having people over and you can't stop people from just like associating with other people as individuals off campus that's, like a clear like constitutional issue, their freedom of association. Anyway, they do attendance for another five minutes than you do like you like mass around for other ten minutes, probably like at the end of the day, you're, not really doing all that much additionally p, e, oftentimes isn't all that enjoyable for people and it's not that enjoyable for people because different people like to exercise in different ways. So we're gonna, focus on two things were going to start by talking about objectification and why opponents of beauty contests, their anger is misplaced in talking about the objectification that exists within beauty contests. This is problematic, not just for the fairness issues behind it, but also because it increases the monopolization of certain industries going back to the computer industry there's already pretty heavily heavy monopolization, but we think of a new start up comes if the good idea for computer hardware it's always going to be snatched up by like intel or some other big firm, and as such, we think then that there's going to be less competition in the market place, prod to oppose. So possibly doing things that are like cruder crossed that make people fit like very uncomfortable being outside in public. The second argument is that this creates profound collective action problems",6,5
"278,519,63,361,391,73,106,333,116,314","We think that because any person would always choose to live in the most developed country possible so that they have the highest quality of life does with the ability to do so those to reap the benefits of develop life because there it leads should try to provide it to everyone else to sort of do unto others as you would have them do unto you type of thinking we see that development is more likely with AC on one because countries have more access to trade partners and trade goods. So what we think is very crucial missed a beat is to point out the start. So first and foremost let's talk about why drinking is bad for the health of young people. This means more and more immersion in sex before you are old enough to even conceptualize it, what it might be government is right, you can't remove all the influences, but you can definitely not add to that fire by removing the age of consent society has gone far enough with sexual icing young women. The second argument is that this creates profound collective action problems. Then removing all the sediment from large parts of north dakota is to those ecosystems. So what happens now is that you have younger children going out and getting cosmetic surgery, recognize that oftentimes parents will want their kids to perform in beauty pageants, or there are like racial stereotypes, individuals want to avoid like model of surgeries. And we think that that's a right that exist regardless of the intent behind whatever those individuals are doing like. In other words, there won't be a land war between the US and russia as long as they have the ability to control international acts through the UN security council. One reason why the cold war never turned hot and why there was never a nuclear war between the soviets and the americans was that they were able to use the united nations as a way to express what was acceptable and unacceptable to them on a global scale",4,7
