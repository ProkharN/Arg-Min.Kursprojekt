"93,92,162,72,348,279,509,309,160,467","This takes time this means that as our children are not really physically ready to have sex, this this social norm is increasingly becoming more and more open to the to the idea that they are with every passing generation One that is logically consistent one that says, look fetuses just don't have rights But we think that what's important here is that there is a precedent not to sell recreational drugs when the public believes that they are unethical or ought not be used and to sell them on the public supports them Compare the way that we drill for oil in the gulf of mexico where a small pipe is driven through the ground, but ultimately very little damage is done now the other side's going to talk about oil spills, I'm sure, but ultimately the harms of the b p oil spill, a few years ago are much less to the gulf of mexico When the federal government forces schools to take certain actions very bad things happen is essential that schools have control over their own curriculum and over their own time, when the federal government gets involved, the act with a new one, it is impossible to regulate every single school in the fact of way we would say that schools in poverty, it schools in low income areas which do not have access to ample physical education equipment and who do not have the resources to watch kids all going outside at the same time, probably do not need physical education But what's important is that right now the u n doesn't, take actions that back major countries into a corner One of those conditions would be say an asymmetry of information that causes direct harm upon the individual because medics surgery doesn't do that you doctors that inform you about what's going to happen with that cosmetic surgery, and the vast majority of cosmetic surgery is safe Specifically, we think that by banning this type of abortion that you give an inch to anti abortion activists and as such hot, this has political ramifications on abortions that are performed at earlier stages, we think there's this bizarre prevailing logic that like if you ban partial birth abortions that signals that like will we're not getting behind the really egregious things in the viscerally obvious things we're just saying that like these, we cases of what abortion should be allowed all make sense Rather, we think that we need these laws in place for those edge cases for when people need to press charges or when someone is being truly abused, these systems are checks in a world where we hope we never have to use them more than this And I think one of the main reasons they engage in beauty contests is because they look at them as practically beneficial to themselves in a number of ways",6,1
"33,478,117,196,72,359,271,133,198,510","Yet these limitations are sets in a manner that is relatively conservative, it like just in order to make sure that whoever violates then still doesn't drive too fast Also, these countries haven't had a war between them in years also probably a good thing like we're, not sure what the mark of success yeah, others trying to reach is, but it seems that these countries are at least partially doing well that may be a marker of success to yes, says look there's, no unifying factor, exactly the point This is very important because alcohol is proven to mess up your brain, a lot of ways to stunt its ability to grow to kill to kill aspects of it and that's a really big problem, because when they're there for when you allow people to take alcohol, a young age you're, essentially allowing them to poison their development, which is obviously not something that we should walk this second thing though, is that due to will do to the increase lack of maturity, that's more likely to be present in younger people there's more of a likelihood that you're going to experience the worst aspects of alcohol What the comparative in this round is we think that in the status quo often times different types of renewable energy resources in a free and open market compete for investments Compare the way that we drill for oil in the gulf of mexico where a small pipe is driven through the ground, but ultimately very little damage is done now the other side's going to talk about oil spills, I'm sure, but ultimately the harms of the b p oil spill, a few years ago are much less to the gulf of mexico But this is also even something that I think people can generally do with pretty good information because when you're considering getting plastic surgery, it's not like doctors are allowed to not tell you the possible risks of surgery on their usually required by law to talk to you about safety affect us possible side effects of surgery, things like that So if you let people drink at eighteen error at yeah at eighteen and then they start drinking, actually at like, fifteen or sixteen than those information that lack of ability to access meaningful information on the practice is even greater Ultimately, we don't see why cosmetic surgery is the one place we all draw the line, particularly when it's conducted by a doctor who presumably can maximize the safety of the procedure, but on top of that, we think that you should always preference more freedom for individuals You have to rebuild the entire power plant they're, not scalar, which means that you're locked in to an inefficient form of energy that won't scale up well in the future I think that the government would point out to you that cosmetic surgery is involved in a large series of norms that are problematic to the average person that they perpetuate body problem",7,1
"153,34,348,288,308,495,178,259,93,312","I think you wind up putting a lot of money into the pockets of people that already have money and saving it off of the people that need these public resources in order to do things like get to their work or get to a hospital or all these other things We think that every given person in society knows their own best interest and their own long term goals better than the government knows any individual goals, we think the government should probably intervene if there are harms to others or if people are grossly lacking in information but that's, not the case here no one else is harmed all deal more with this in just a minute, but no one else is harmed by you choosing to get facelift and in terms of access to information doctors are already legally obliged to provide you with a great deal of information When the federal government forces schools to take certain actions very bad things happen is essential that schools have control over their own curriculum and over their own time, when the federal government gets involved, the act with a new one, it is impossible to regulate every single school in the fact of way we would say that schools in poverty, it schools in low income areas which do not have access to ample physical education equipment and who do not have the resources to watch kids all going outside at the same time, probably do not need physical education We think it's clear that we should not abolish intellectual property rights First on it, why it's not justified to them recognize that cosmetic surgery, doesn't hurt the people who is were doing it, and it doesn't have any overflow arms right So first on fairness, broadly we would say that property rights are important and all be protected, we would say that people exert effort time and put their own labor into the products of their creation, and because they are the sole creators of the primary creators of their products Second thing to say here is that we think that the changes in social norms just continue on happening in the pattern of like an ongoing race to younger and younger ages People harpies believes about themselves, and they can't just choose to feel good about their bodies This takes time this means that as our children are not really physically ready to have sex, this this social norm is increasingly becoming more and more open to the to the idea that they are with every passing generation We should not adopt libertarianism, because I think on both principal and on a practical level of how the world works libertarianism is a rather flawed ideology, so let's start by talking about what actually defines libertarianism",5,1
"213,456,248,394,53,317,365,471,473,422","We should abolish the security council veto in the status quo The reason why physical education shouldn't be mandatory isn't because exercises bad all the isley exercise is a good thing if anything people clearly don't do it and nothing, the status quo They don't understand, they can't conceptualize what brain damage looks like, or what a lifetime of being addicted to alcohol might look like, and also we have to protect them until they can consent into those protect potential harms One yell starts out with the assumption that this has been tried for years and has failed we're, not entirely sure where he gets the notion that it failed So we're gonna, focus on two things were going to start by talking about objectification and why opponents of beauty contests, their anger is misplaced in talking about the objectification that exists within beauty contests We should not abolish the US electoral college, so well, people may be with an uproar given that the two of the last five presidential elections resulted in a result in which the popular vote winner did not win the electoral college and therefore did not become president of the united states The vast majority of people are just born into the state that they live in, or they were forced to live in the state by the circumstances out of their control The nature of the internet is that no one country can regulate it We want to a lesser reliance on these and that's the best way to actually reduce our carbon footprint, and this creates a bit of a problem because when you keep exploiting what you already have you're essentially just conceding to being lazy and sheep and kind of stupid to be honest because you're not reinvesting in greentech, an infrastructure as you should be you're, just relying on the things that you already have access to as well And this is the next thing we want to talk about is that your body is still developing you're, much more likely to impair your mental development to impair your decision making process used to alcohol use while you are young than later in your life when your brain, your body has four more fully developed",5,1
"107,78,176,284,428,217,263,125,294,126","The reason why the government is a better actor in many cases them private actors is because there's democratic control over the government So what we see is that britain is now at a disadvantage in producing energy relative to its neighbors in the european union, we tell you there for that So all the first argument that it reduces the incentive to create, I think this is hinted at in god's arguments where they are like all will, you know, some people say that I think people set up for a pretty good reason right, like we're recognize it like if you are a person producing medicine like if you are a pharmaceutical company, you just don't have an incentive to create that medicine because you're investing billions of dollars into it Our second point is that banning anonymous posting is completely unenforceable They talk about how this medic surgery enhances the model of beauty and all of its harms to society So for all these reasons do not ban partial birth abortion It is designed in such a way that affording you, these privileges will get you to become a more mature person by exposing you to new things in life So the popular vote doesn't always have a majority, but the electoral college does the deeper impact of this is that it reduces for force recalls and dragged out elections We tell you that ultimately, the huge drop in oil prices globally has done more to harm ordinary people living in petroleum states that it's done to their governments But for the most part, you don't need that many like staffers that you don't need like a coal plant, for example, that really drives in industry from the resource extraction in the running of the plant, like it's, not like that wind power really just doesn't have that many jobs associated with it",5,1
"420,490,44,511,282,95,446,218,353,397","We think things like roads, we think a central emergency services must be solved through collective action So we essentially think that getting excessive cosmetic surgery is a response to a patriarchal system, so sure it also works to reaffirm and we think that if you were to change the over arching system, people would stop feeling the need to do this, and we think about something that the government should always focus on more than just changing the symptoms first because it's more effective but second, because we think that if the government can't promise of attraction of the full system, people should be able to operate within it as they please proud to oppose And being able to post anonymously, brings a kind of shield your identity, and it makes it more likely that you could be willing to engage and express your thoughts in the first place This is obviously a gradual situation, but we believe that then within a few generations, we will most definitely be there We think that intellectual property rights ensure that creators get to profit off of their efforts to get to profit off of their intellectual property What these bio fuels do is a leech into the environment and bleach and to the environment to the pesticides used to grow them and then cost massive amounts to make in the first place But the problem with this is that if an individual isn't old enough to understand the consequences, the action, it isn't reasonable to call that consenting into the action or autonomy by any means our second independent point is that people will always drink before the drinking age gulf makes a lot of noise over the fact that people tend to abuse the drinking age arm and drink before it's legal Both of these are terrible options that are far more likely if the cartel has no other option, the cartel has huge infrastructure, put in place to smuggle goods into the united states and will continue these paths Our first independent point, which I think really cuts to the meat of almost everything that government tells you is that specifically banning cosmetic surgery on the basis that it perpetuates misogynist norms is itself blaming women and victims broadly arm for the you know, damage that is inflicted upon them when we hear from government specifically the line that we need to ban cosmetic surgery, you know, because this is this socially harmful practice that can drives artificial beauty norms So there's, really nothing that you could actually do about banning fraternities in an off campus, informal capacity",7,1
"281,39,518,263,483,487,112,495,516,210","They also don't into the media on their side of the house, recognize the real influencer that causes people to see drinking as glamorous thing that they should do is the fact that media everywhere portrays it as something really really cool Yeah, we would say that solar power is immensely further advance, especially given that there are companies like solar city run by you on must that already have immense amounts of resources at their disposal and are already putting products on the market We usually say that eighteen year old probably shouldn't drink because they're prefrontal cortex is growing expanding and essentially becoming more effective alcohol can inhibit this, but if children as young as ten are drinking alcohol, the entirety of their brain is growing their forening, the synapses that will be effective in living for their entire lives, they consume alcohol at this young age, we would say that they were likely to face profound consequences for their overall development, the likely to face more issues later in life, anger, issues emotional issues as they are not able to effectively grow It is designed in such a way that affording you, these privileges will get you to become a more mature person by exposing you to new things in life There are few political ideologies as fundamentally misconstrued as fundamentally miss championed as libertarianism is a system which favors the rich and the powerful, although the adoption of libertarianism in many ways seems like the adoption of natural forms of power, natural ways of thinking So in the status quo, the united states is comprised largely of a group of really big states that make up the majority of its population and a lot of small states We think it's unfair that you restrict that choice and trying to find solutions to issues and solutions to a patriarchal system So first on fairness, broadly we would say that property rights are important and all be protected, we would say that people exert effort time and put their own labor into the products of their creation, and because they are the sole creators of the primary creators of their products It connects them to times gone by a family that they've lost relatives to communities that they are part of now and provides a sense of continuity to those communities as such What this means is that every year that teens get older, they are able to make better and better decisions biologically, but on top of that, every decision that you make is informed by past experience, people who have more experience are more likely to be able to make good decisions",6,1
"136,397,297,219,256,476,307,361,251,101","And because you can get high concentrations of higher concentrations of mercury as a result of that, but in addition to the direct harms of fracking there's also incredibly prominent in direct harms that come from fracking, namely that further dependence on oil and other non renewable sources of energy like it are very unclean source of energy will only further on lead to more global warming and climate change So there's, really nothing that you could actually do about banning fraternities in an off campus, informal capacity So it's a balancing factor it's, a system of the checks and balances that were created internally to the u s government it'll, it ensures that those big states get greater representation in a way that the otherwise don't in the senate, which means that in the highest office, those states are balanced out by the fact that in the senate they don't get as much of a voice as many think they should But we also just think if the government doesn't have a right to ban it like there are plenty of problematic activities that happen in so far as you can still make children go to hip hop classes that sexualized them and promote the same kind of objectification it's unclear So first I'm, like a principled level, the idea of libertarianism is that were most free if there's minimal state intervention, we have ownership over our own property, but I think the problem is that when you have minimal state intervention, things you don't actually even achieve the outcome of people being most free So in so far as the cultural harms that sam talks about exist on both sides of the house, the question is just how comfortably can women access the solution, we think that is what matters most in this round, proud to oppose Word is wildly on regulated and as such the abuses internalized by animals are much more significant and much more extreme given that then we think there is significant harm intrinsic to making this sort of practice illegal and making it harder to conduct this in an open arms in an open and public fashion where you know, government officials can step in and say these practices are humane This means more and more immersion in sex before you are old enough to even conceptualize it, what it might be government is right, you can't remove all the influences, but you can definitely not add to that fire by removing the age of consent society has gone far enough with sexual icing young women I also just think that oftentimes it can be used to celebrate different kinds of attractiveness, certainly maybe not body type The veto was basically what makes the united nations useful if there's no security council veto, then there's no reason for powerful countries like russia or the united states which can impose their will globally without need for recourse to the united nations to participate in the united nations we see that in the past, the united nations has been extremely successful at preventing war between powerful countries",8,1
"392,190,297,356,123,107,332,199,385,219","We think this is because individuals have the ability to make decisions based on their personal preferences and priorities that the state simply doesn't know or understand There were also harm these countries for all the economics and security reasons, but I touched on before for these reasons, we should not disband asia So it's a balancing factor it's, a system of the checks and balances that were created internally to the u s government it'll, it ensures that those big states get greater representation in a way that the otherwise don't in the senate, which means that in the highest office, those states are balanced out by the fact that in the senate they don't get as much of a voice as many think they should So if you think that people get value off of art or if people get value from listening to music, if it makes our lives better it's important, make sure the you're supporting the people who give you that sense of happiness when you listen to a great song and debate we which this is supported, is by making sure they're able to make a living by doing what they're doing, but without an intellectual property right it's, impossible for them to actually make this living because anyone can just rip them off use their song Before you reach up further tipping point, we think that even if you are able to get unconventional oil in a clean way, even if you're able to do it without destroying ecosystems you're only adding to the problem in the status quo you're, only allowing for more dirty energy to be produced, which we think is unacceptable is unacceptable is only going to lead to dramatic harms for the future of society for future people The reason why the government is a better actor in many cases them private actors is because there's democratic control over the government The drinking age, the first is that a higher drinking age limits access for teens It just means that people are going to move to the deep web or non public communities and do all of this in secret and more than that, though, even if they do get rid of it somehow they're still like the people who would be part of this are still going to help those stocks right, like at least with anonymous forms, you're able to know how much of that exists in society in the first place which can be useful for preparing yourself with how to deal with it My second overview is about the idea of government action government should not go in and ban anything that they feel is problematic But we also just think if the government doesn't have a right to ban it like there are plenty of problematic activities that happen in so far as you can still make children go to hip hop classes that sexualized them and promote the same kind of objectification it's unclear",8,1
"0,331,263,200,420,162,145,253,198,502","Adults do they can take actions that harm others such as driving while drunk, we think a higher drinking it allows you to ensure that when people do these types of things you can pull them aside, you can rest them So we think that animal rights exist on most standards that of of deserves right that excludes animals are often arbitrary and internally contradictory It is designed in such a way that affording you, these privileges will get you to become a more mature person by exposing you to new things in life And we think that that kind of thing should not be banned in so far as women will still have to do things like be attractive for men on both sides of the house We think things like roads, we think a central emergency services must be solved through collective action But we think that what's important here is that there is a precedent not to sell recreational drugs when the public believes that they are unethical or ought not be used and to sell them on the public supports them We think things like facial features are also often just like in skin tone The technology that allows for these batteries, the solar cell batteries to store their electricity You have to rebuild the entire power plant they're, not scalar, which means that you're locked in to an inefficient form of energy that won't scale up well in the future So really the comparative is would you rather have for attorneys be on campus in a more regular fashion",4,1
